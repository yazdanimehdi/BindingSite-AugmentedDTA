# Exciting News Ahead!

:sparkles: **Coming Soon**: We are thrilled to announce that a new project, the [DeepDrugDomain Package](https://github.com/yazdanimehdi/deepdrugdomain), is in the works! While this current repository has served us well, we're gearing up for an exciting transition to a more advanced and feature-rich package.

The DeepDrugDomain Package will offer enhanced capabilities for drug-target interaction and affinity prediction, integrating the latest advancements in the field. Although the repository is not public yet, we're just putting on the finishing touches.

Keep an eye on this page for future updates and the big reveal!

Thank you for your interest and support!
